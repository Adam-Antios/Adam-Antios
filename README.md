### Adamantios

Research Engineer | Data Scientist

My background is in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Currently, I work on Machine Learning and Signal Processing algorithms for devices based on Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. The main applications of those devices include gait kinematic analysis and human activity recognition (HAR). My research interests include:

* Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,
* Data Science, Engineering and Visualization,
* Signal Processing and Time Series Analysis.
